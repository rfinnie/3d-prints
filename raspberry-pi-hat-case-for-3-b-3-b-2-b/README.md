# Raspberry Pi HAT case for 3 B+ / 3 B / 2 B

This is a remix of a low-profile Raspberry Pi case, with a few options specifically for HATs.

  - v4\_bottom - Same base as source thing.
  - v4\_top - Same top as source thing. Only the lowest-profile heatsinks will work with this, but has a decorative mostly-enclosed top.
  - v4\_top\_minimal - Same as v4\_top but with most of the enclosed top removed. Good for using with heatsinks, or HATs which have some underside protrustions.
  - v4\_flush\_top\_minimal - Same as v4\_top\_minimal, but 3mm taller. This makes the top of the case flush with standard size HATs (see photo).

Underside wood screws are required to join the bottom and top layers, either flat M2.5 x 10mm, or flat \#4 x 3/8". There are holes on the top as well if you need to secure the HAT, but (especially on the flush variant) it's not required.
