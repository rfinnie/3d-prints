# Reinforced PCI / ISA Slot Bracket for IDE 40pin to SD adapter

Remixed from "PCI / ISA Slot Bracket for IDE 40pin to SD adapter", this adds the following enhancements:

  - Thicker triangle areas along the bracket so stress from inserting/removing the SD card doesn't flex the bracket as much.
  - Enclosed bracket screw hole, no standalone small tab to break on top.
  - Longer bottom tab, which should completely clear any slot's receiver hole.

Printing notes:

  - The triangle shaped brace running the length of the bracket is at a negative angle, but is less than 60 degrees and should not need support.
  - It's possible the bottom tab may be too long in certain conditions. If so, just use tin snips or similar to cut the tab down to size.
  - For mounting the IDE2SD card, I personally enlarge the printed mounting holes using a 7/64" drill bit, and screw them in with standard coarse-thread machine PC screws. It's possible to screw in without pre-drilling, but takes a lot of force.
