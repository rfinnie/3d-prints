# Yet Another Ender 3 V2 fan assembly remix (Satsana style, BLTouch, 4010 + 5015 fans)

Posted as a remix for a commenter on [my make](https://www.thingiverse.com/make:931960) of the ideal ["Satsana Duct Remix for Ender 3v2 - integrated BLTouch mount (4010 + 5015 fans)"](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4770095), plus the following changes:

  - Added a cross bar between the front of the BLTouch mount and the main body for just a little extra rigidity
  - Added a side cutout next to the rightmost V2 mounting hole
  - Closed up and partially filled in the unused inward hole used to screw in a hole on non-V2 Ender 3 models.

Also included are modified \#6 and \#8 variants of [these BLTouch shrouds](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4634422) but with M3 nut holes cut out, as seen in the photo above.
