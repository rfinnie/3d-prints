# IDE2SD 3.5" enclosure with additional mounting options

tl;dr this IDE to SD housing may be used as either an external 3.5" bay, or in the footprint of a 3.5" hard drive.

This is a modification of tomtetom04's IDE2SD 3.5" housing, with the following changes:

  - There are additional screw mounting holes on the side and underside which match a 3.5" hard drive's screw holes. The rear of this print lines up with the rear (IDE-side) of an actual 3.5" hard drive, so it can be used completely internally.
  - Removed some extraneous material to save on print time.

Note that the IDE port is toward the middle of the enclosure and the Molex port faces straight up, so it's recommended you use the IDE2SD with a short 40-pin extension cable and a short FDD (floppy) to Molex adapter.
