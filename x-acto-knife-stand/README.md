# X-Acto Knife Stand

Here's a holder for two X-Acto craft knives, plus an X-Acto blade dispenser and collector. It was designed and tested with a \#1 handle and \#11 blades, but should have enough give to accept \#2 handles and \#1 blades, among others.

The inner blade cavity is at an angle, but supports are not needed.

The decorative outer angles and top can be a bit ugly at 0.15, but are perfectly functional. Go down to 0.10 for a more clean appearance.
