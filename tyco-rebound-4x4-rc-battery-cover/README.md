# Tyco Rebound 4x4 RC battery cover

The "standard" STL is a dimensionally accurate recreation of the battery cover, but the problem is at 1.6mm wide, the upright door is too fragile to be pushed in to open/close repeatedly, and will quickly snap.

After some experimentation, I've also made a version with a strengthened door which is tougher, but still has enough give so you can push in to open/close. (This version also has an easter egg under the door.)

Print at 100% infill (infill reduction on these models save almost no filament, but will reduce strength), no supports needed.

The pictures depict the strengthened version, but with part of the door removed to facilitate a battery mod I'm working on.
