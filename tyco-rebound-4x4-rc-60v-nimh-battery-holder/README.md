# Tyco Rebound 4x4 RC 6.0v NiMH battery holder

This battery sled replaces the standard spring-loaded "6.0v JET TURBO" NiCD battery (all of which are probably dead at this point) with a 5-cell 6.0v NiMH battery which you can find on Amazon, eBay, etc. Note however:

  - The connector leads outside the battery bay. You could snap off part of the original battery door but I do have [a 3D printed replica battery door](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4830268) also available.
  - Because of this, you'll also need to get the connector to mate up with the internal PCB. I actually replaced the original Tyco PCB with a modern 2.4GHz toy's PCB ("[OYE HOYE LED RC Stunt Cars for Kids](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WBYL8XL)" on Amazon, but other clones will probably be the same), so I was able to route the battery connector through what used to be the hole for the power switch.
