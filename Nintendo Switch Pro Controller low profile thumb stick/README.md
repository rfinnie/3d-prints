# Nintendo Switch Pro Controller low profile thumb stick

I wanted to take a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller and use it with a RetroPie primarily digitally (with thumbs on the cross and face buttons), but I found my thumbs were rubbing up against the sides of the original thumbsticks. These replacements allow the analog sticks to remain usable (surprisingly usable, actually), but take up much less space than the originals.

Print as fine as possible (I used 0.1mm), infill is probably fine but I didn't use it. You'll need supports for where the shaft meets the top of the dome, but you'll want to put a support blocker on top of the shaft itself to avoid getting support material stuck in the shaft.

BTW, the photos are of a regular Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, just with an aftermarket purple shell (with the same dimensions as the original shell).
