# Eyoyo 8" S801H monitor stand

This is similar to [another Eyoyo 8" 4x3 monitor stand](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4755077), but with the following differences:

  - Monitor tilted 20 degrees back instead of 10 degrees
  - Larger, heavier base, with more material in back to make it easier to press buttons on the monitor
  - Cable hole large enough to fit a VGA or HDMI cable through
  - Tie-down hole for Velcro/ziptie loop for keeping cables secure
