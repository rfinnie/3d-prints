# Power brick / wall wart cord wrap

Nice design for North American power bricks (wall warts) to wrap the attached cord. Compatible with polarized and 3-prong plugs.

The unified design is recommended as it supports both horizontal and vertical bricks with one print. However, the previous separate designs are included.

This was roughly inspired by a [EU design for a specific power brick](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4586428), but is otherwise unrelated.
